1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C) and generously grease a a mini bundt cake pan.

2. Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl and set aside.

3. With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. With the mixer running on low speed, add the eggs one at a time, then add the sour cream, vanilla extract, vanilla bean, and almond extract (if using). Beat on medium-high speed until combined. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. With the mixer running on low speed, slowly add the dry ingredients. Beat everything just until incorporated. Do not over-mix. Batter will be very creamy and thick with lots of vanilla bean specks.

4. Spoon batter into pan, filling each bundt cake cavity 2/3 full. If you need to make a 2nd batch, loosely cover the leftover batter and keep at room temperature until your pan is ready again.

5. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the cakes are lightly golden and spring back when lightly poked with your finger. Remove from the oven and allow to cool inside the pan for 5 minutes. Carefully invert the pan on the counter or wire rack. Give the pan a little shake so the cakes release. Allow bundt cakes to cool completely on a wire rack before icing and serving.
